# Customer_Segmentation_project


## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to segment customers into distinct groups to enhance our understanding of their behaviors and preferences.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

The dataset was collected from various sources and cleaned by removing missing values. The cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_customer_data.csv`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Basic statistics and visualizations were performed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

## Clustering

K-means clustering was applied to segment the customers. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method.

## Validation and Visualization

The clusters were validated using the Silhouette Score and visualized using pair plots. The cluster centers were also examined to understand the characteristics of each segment.

## Findings

The analysis revealed distinct customer segments with unique purchasing behaviors and preferences. These insights can be used to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation is a powerful tool for understanding and targeting different customer groups. By leveraging these insights, businesses can enhance their marketing efforts and drive growth.
